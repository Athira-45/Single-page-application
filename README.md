Project Description:
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a dynamic web application that loads a single HTML page and updates content seamlessly without refreshing the entire page. It uses client-side routing and asynchronous data fetching to deliver fast, fluid user experiences, often leveraging frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. SPAs are ideal for interactive platforms such as dashboards, portfolios, or product catalogs, offering improved performance, reduced server load, and a more app-like feel across devices.
